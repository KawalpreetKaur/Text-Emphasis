# Text-Emphasis
Sometimes you want to make certain words appear more powerful than the rest of the text, and making text bold cannot be enough. I built a page using HTML and CSS having some quotations, and focussed on laying emphasis on some of the words of the sentences by CSS properties.
The text-emphasis CSS property applies emphasis marks to the text to make the text look more powerful and noticeable.
